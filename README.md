# Logi POP Mouse emoji button binder

I have a [Logi POP Mouse](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/pop-wireless-mouse.html) it's a small, lightweight, and affordable Bluetooth mouse. I use it with my laptops, primarily on Linux.
The issue is that the mouse has a button in the middle (referred to as the Emoji Button on Logi's website), and it doesn't perform any function on Linux.
On my PC, I use a SteelSeries Sensei MLG edition (2012) that comes with side buttons, allowing me to navigate back and forward, for instance, in a web browser or within an IDE.
I missed this functionality, particularly the ability to go back one page. On Windows and MacOS, there is driver software called [Logi Options+](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/software/logi-options-plus.html) that allows you to customize actions for buttons.  


#### TODO:
- [x] Get emoji button press/release event
- [x] Send custom event using X11?
- [ ] Create a config for a 1 single event?
- [ ] Better error handling
- [ ] Run as daemon
- [ ] Write description
